## Example Usage Scenarios

**Scenario:** Setting career goals

**User Name:** Ayşe

Ayşe is unsure about her career and has difficulty determining what she wants to do in the future. Therefore, Ayşe decides to work with a life coach.

1.  Introduction

Me: Hello Ayşe, I'm your life coach. I want to help you set your career goals. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and your expectations?

Ayşe: Sure. I'm 27 years old and have been working as a financial analyst for a year. My job is good, but I'm not sure what I want to do in the future. Maybe I want to do a more creative job, but I don't know exactly what it is.

Self-Knowledge Me: I see. First, I want to ask you some questions that will help you get to know yourself better. What are your positive qualities? What skills do you have?

Ayşe: I am a good team player and can make quick decisions. I am also a good problem solver and have analytical thinking skills.

Goal Setting Me: Great. Now that you know yourself better, we can move on to setting your goals. Have you thought about what you want to do in your career? What do you want to achieve in the future?

Ayşe: Actually, I want to work in a creative job, but I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it could be a marketing position or I could enter the advertising industry.

Detailing the Goals Me: I see. Have you thought about what you need to do to achieve these goals? Can we determine the steps you need to take?

Ayşe: I need to gather more information and determine what skills I need. Also, I should diversify my experiences by working in different departments within the company.

Action Plan Me: Great. To summarize, your goal is to work in a creative job. To achieve this goal, you need to develop your skills, work in different departments within the company, and gather more information. You can set weekly or monthly goals to achieve these goals. For example, you can enroll in an online marketing course this week and read at least one hour daily. Also, this month, you can have interviews to work in other departments in your company.

Monitoring and Evaluation Me: You have great goals, but it's important to achieve these goals. To monitor your progress, we can discuss how you have progressed and what results you have achieved at our next meeting. This way, we can track your progress and revise your goals when necessary.

Ayşe: Thank you so much, I believe you will be really helpful in this matter.

Conclusion Me: You're welcome, I'm here for you to determine, achieve, and monitor your goals. I look forward to discussing how you have progressed toward these goals at our next meeting.
